### 🚀 What Can It Do?

Here are some of the core features of Analyzr:

- **Real-Time Tracking:** See what's happening on your website as it happens.

- **Custom Event Tracking:** Track specific actions your visitors take (for example, clicks on certain buttons).
  
  Here's how to track custom events:

  Using JavaScript/Node.js:
  ```javascript
  const axios = require('axios');
  
  const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  const url = "https://getanalyzr.vercel.app/api/events";
  const headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
  };
  
  const eventData = {
      name: "",        // required - event name
      domain: "",      // required - your website domain
      description: "", // required - event description
      emoji: "🔔",    // optional - emoji for Discord notification
      fields: [       // optional - additional fields for Discord notification
        {
          name: "Field Name",
          value: "Field Value", 
          inline: true // optional - display fields in same line
        }
      ]
  };
  
  const sendRequest = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.post(url, eventData, { headers });
        console.log("Event sent successfully", response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
      }
  };
  
  sendRequest();
  ```

  Using Python:
  ```python
  import requests
  
  API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  url = "https://getanalyzr.vercel.app/api/events"
  headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
  }
  
  event_data = {
      "name": "",        # required - event name
      "domain": "",      # required - your website domain
      "description": "", # required - event description
      "emoji": "🔔",    # optional - emoji for Discord notification
      "fields": [       # optional - additional fields for Discord notification
        {
          "name": "Field Name",
          "value": "Field Value",
          "inline": True # optional - display fields in same line
        }
      ]
  }
  
  def send_request():
      try:
          response = requests.post(url, json=event_data, headers=headers)
          response.raise_for_status()
          print("Event sent successfully", response.json())
      except requests.exceptions.RequestException as error:
          print("Error:", error)
  
  send_request()
  ```

  Yes, it's that simple!

- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor how fast your site loads (and find areas to improve with smart suggestions on what to optimize next).

- **Device & Browser Stats:** See what devices, browsers, and operating systems your visitors are using.

- **Location Tracking:** Understand where your visitors are coming from.

- **Discord Notifications:** Get live updates on events right in your Discord DM.

### How Does It Work?

![Diagram](./public/diagram.png)

Here's exactly how Analyzr works, with no secrets:

First, you add our tracking script to your website - it's just a simple piece of code that counts when people visit your pages and what they click on.

This information goes straight to Supabase (our database provider), which organizes all this data.

We store everything safely in Supabase's storage system.

When you log in to your dashboard, you'll see all this information displayed in charts and numbers.

And if you want, we can send updates about your website straight to your Discord - it's that straightforward!

You can look at our code on GitHub to see exactly how everything works.

### 🤖 Discord Integration
